## ðŸ”§ SDK Compatibility Note

This project uses `firebase_auth`, which requires a minimum Android SDK version of **23**.  
For that reason, the `minSdkVersion` has been explicitly set to 23 in the `android/app/build.gradle` file:

```gradle
defaultConfig {
  minSdk = 23 // Required by Firebase Auth
  ...
}
